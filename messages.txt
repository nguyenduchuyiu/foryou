some moments are better shared in silence... but i wish you were there.
no need for words. just this smile, just this frame.
sent this because i couldn’t send the way i look at you.
there’s a scene missing… you.
it’s just a random clip — until you realize why it matters.
maybe this doesn’t mean much. but maybe, it means a little more than i’ll ever say.
wish this frame could hold you, not just pixels.
this isn’t a video. it’s a whisper i didn’t know how to say out loud.
if you see this, you're part of the main character arc.
100% not edited just to impress one person. definitely not.
totally casual. totally not hoping you’d notice.
pov: i had something to say, so i coded it instead.
it’s just html, css… and maybe a tiny crush.
if this feels oddly personal… it probably is.
i made this website. you made it meaningful.
just another page on the internet. until you read between the lines.
remember that one moment we shared? this is me remembering it.
we stopped talking. but i kept thinking.
maybe this is how i start again — without breaking the silence too loudly.
i don’t expect you to reply. just wanted you to see this exists.
it’s okay if this just passes by. but if it doesn’t, i’m here.
i can't rewind time — so i replay it with code instead.
this might not reach you. but it already meant something to me.
if you’re reading this… maybe fate took the scenic route.
it’s easier to render animations than render feelings.
here’s a frame. here’s a hint. here’s me, not saying it out loud.
you left. but your echo stayed in my codebase.
i debug programs, not feelings. but this one bug stayed unfixed.
there’s no ui for heartbreak. so i designed something else.
every pixel here? lowkey screaming your name.
wanted to say hi. ended up building a website.
maybe this is cringe. or maybe it’s the softest thing i’ve done.
the site looks cool. but you noticing it? that’s the goal.
if you ask me who it’s for, i’ll pretend i don’t know.
not trying to win you back. just trying to be brave differently.
this is either the most lowkey confession — or just art.
i wrote this for no one. unless you’re reading it. then it’s you.
not asking for anything. just showing up in a way i know how.
guess i never stopped caring. just changed the format.
sometimes love is just… persistent ui updates.
you’re not in this video. but you’re in every idea behind it.
